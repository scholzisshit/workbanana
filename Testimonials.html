<p>workbanana is not a freelance marketplace like Upwork or Fiverr. Instead, we're a lead generation tool you can plug into your existing freelance business. Here's what happens once you sign up:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tell us exactly what kinds of freelance jobs you want to receive. Adjust location, budget, keywords, and much more for a custom-tailored experience.</li>
  <li>Our talented team of "gig hunters" along with powerful AI matching tools work together to search the most popular freelance job sources including job boards, marketplaces, RFPs, social media, and more.</li>
  <li>When our team finds a gig that fits your search rules, we'll add it to your dashboard. Plus, we'll send you an email so you never miss a great opportunity.</li>
  <li>Click the "send a pitch" button and you'll automatically be sent to the original source. We don't force you into our ecosystem. And we don't take a percentage of your paycheck.</li>
</ol>

<p>Need we say more? Say goodbye to spending 50% of your workweek hunting down your next client. Let us do it for you—freeing up time for you to grow your business.</p>
